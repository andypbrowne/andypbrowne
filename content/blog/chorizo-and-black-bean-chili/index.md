Take care of tonight’s “what’s for dinner” question. Just toss chorizo, black beans, and tomato sauce into a pot, let it do its thing, and finish it off with a spoonful of sour cream, a sprinkle of cilantro, and some freshly chopped onions.

1. Prep & brown chorizo - Halve onion and finely chop. Finely chop 2 teaspoons garlic. In a medium pot, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high. Add chorizo and cook, breaking up into smaller pieces, until browned in spots and no longer pink, 4–5 minutes (chorizo won't be cooked through).
2. Cook aromatics - To pot with chorizo, add chopped garlic and half of the chopped onions; reserve rest for step 4. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, 4–6 minutes. Add chorizo chili spice and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Simmer chili - To same pot, add beans and their liquid, tomato sauce, 1½ cups water, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper. Bring to a boil over high. Reduce heat to medium-low and partially cover with a lid or foil. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened to a rich stew-like consistency, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. Prep toppings & serve - While chili simmers, finely chop cilantro leaves and stems. In a small bowl, cover reserved chopped onions with water; soak for 10 minutes, then drain. Serve chorizo and black bean chili in bowls garnished with sour cream, onions, and cilantro. Enjoy!
