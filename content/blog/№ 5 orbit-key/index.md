The [Orbitkey Organizer](https://www.orbitkey.com/collections/active/products/orbitkey-2-0-active?variant=8198980993120) is just one of those products that I didn’t know I could’t live without. Keys in your pocket tend to poke (painful) and jingle (annoying). This solves for that. Plus the shape of the thing is a nice way to manipulate they key.

One time I dropped this thing while shoveling snow and I thought it was lost forever. Somehow my partner searched and found it. So thankful to her for always being the determined and persistent person that she is. Naturally I now have an Air Tag attached to that same set of keys.
