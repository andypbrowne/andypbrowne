Here are some descriptions of the stickers on my laptop. I enjoy the aesthetics of the stickers – but what I enjoy mostly is the reminder of what they represent. That background listed from left to right and top-to-bottom. As the great designer Aaron Draplin would say &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be precious about your stickers, if you have a sticker, stick it!&rdquo;

### Heatonist

One of the best YouTube channels continues to be [First We Feast](https://www.youtube.com/user/FirstWeFeast) and their show Hot Ones, a show with hot wings and even hotter questions. Some great recent episodes include [Jason Bateman](https://youtu.be/nArSMnm9ETo?si=udIeD-1ZFdmEwQXI), [will Forte](https://youtu.be/ITj3o5T4Szc?si=QZw_K7bVuUP0bMRS), and [Selena Gomez](https://youtu.be/NYH3pAYRrBM?si=5z2O1nMnUcSLgVUj). 

### Party Corgi

From time to time I still watch [Learn With Jason](https://codetv.dev/series/learn-with-jason/s8) with Jason Lengstorf. He pair programs with great folks from around the tech industry. Its a great way to learn web development and how debugging is the process even for the experts. I’m also reminded that creativity is the mostly important skill for working on the web. This sticker was sold on his personal site and reminds me to bring my own creativity to my personal and professional projects. 

### Artmageddon

My neighborhood in Ditmas Park Brooklyn hosts and [arts festival](https://www.beautifybrooklyn.org/) every year in the fall. My favorite parts are the crafted branding and the zines they have recently started producing. Ask me about the edition about Snowy the Cat. 

### The Center for Urban Petagogy (CUP)

An organization that continues to inspire me – [CUP](https://welcometocup.org/) collaborates with organizations to design information about public policies, processes, and systems, accessible. I was finally able to acquire one of thier stickers when visiting the [Brooklyn Fine Art Print Fair](https://powerhousearts.org/print-fair). 

### Threes Brewing

There has been a resurgence of craft breweries in Brooklyn, and across the country, over the past several years. One of my favorites is [Threes Brewing](https://threesbrewing.com/) because of the delicious beer and their very fun artwork. The fine illustration work on their tall-boy cans remind me of Saul Bass and the catch phrases are very unique. Their most famous and perhaps my favorite all around is Logical Conclusion. I saved that sticker for this laptop but actually drink more of the Vliet Pilsner.

I previously have written about [laptop stickers in 2022](https://andypbrowne.com/blog/laptop-stickers/). I’ll also add more stickers to my current laptop and this post until it’s time to get a new laptop.
