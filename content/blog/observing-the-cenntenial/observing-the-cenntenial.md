<p class="serif"><span class="small-caps">From 2014 to 2018 we commemorate</span> the centennial of &#8220;The Great War,&#8221; so-called because those who experienced it could imagine no conflict more terrible, and could not believe that the same disastrous mistakes could ever be repeated. Removed by as much as three generations from life today, the events of <span class="small-caps">1914&#8211;18</span> hold lessons and truths about our humanity that could be lost&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;or worse&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;be rendered unbelievable. I would like to share with you some web resources that capture the Centennial, commemorate that time, and show how <span class="small-caps">WWI</span> still shapes our political and cultural environment today.</p>

<p class="serif">The Great War was set off June <span class="small-caps">28, 1914</span> by a small spark&#8212;the assassination of Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie Duchess of Hohenberg. The meaning of this event is summed up expertly by Dan Carlin in a recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41zHpBoZvd4" rel="nofollow"><em>CBS This Morning Television Interview</em></a><em> (youtube video)</em>. This short interview is just a taste of Carlin&#8217;s exhaustive and fascinating five-part podcast series, <a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-50-blueprint-for-armageddon-i/" rel="nofollow"><em>Blueprint for Armageddon</em></a><em> (podcast link)</em>.</p>

<p class="serif">Each innovation spurred more innovations as <span class="small-caps">20th</span>-century technology made its first appearance in wartime. Commanders applied time-honored tactics to battlegrounds evolving more rapidly than ever before in history. The scale of killing was impossible to predict as governments deployed accurate, long-range artillery, combined arms, barbed wire, the machine gun, chemical releases, submarines, battleships, and the tank.</p>

<p class="serif"><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/wwi/wwitech/" rel="nofollow"><em> A photo essay from the Atlantic Monthly Magazine</em></a> captures a multitude of these advances in warfare.</p>

<p class="serif">The <span class="small-caps">&#8220;war to end all wars&#8221;</span> was never that, but rather a foreshadowing of the destructive power that could yet destroy the human race.</p>

Land campaigns involved Africa and Asia and naval engagements extended to the Indian and Pacific oceans as well as the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean and North seas.

<blockquote class="serif large">In Flanders fields the poppies blow<br>
Between the crosses, row on row,<br>
That mark our place; and in the sky<br>
The larks, still bravely singing, fly<br>
Scarce heard amid the guns below.</blockquote>
    
<blockquote class="serif large">We are the Dead.<br>
Short days ago we lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,<br>
Loved and were loved, and now we lie<br>
In Flanders fields.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="serif large">Take up our quarrel with the foe:<br>
To you from failing hands we throw<br>
The torch; be yours to hold it high.<br>
If ye break faith with us who die<br>
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields.</blockquote>

    <span class="small-caps">Among the organizations guiding the commemoration</span> of the centennial, the <a href="http://www.flandershouse.org/house" rel="nofollow"><em>Flanders House NY</em></a> provides a gateway between Flanders, Belgium and the United States. Their programming provides a strong platform for meaningful response. In particular their focus on the arts is a great gesture to the men, women, and children of the <span class="small-caps">WWI</span> era and to those of us today who wish to honor and learn from their experience in this monumental event.

    Have a look and tell me what you think. I welcome constructive comments and recommendations for further study as I move forward with plans to expand, illustrate and provide ongoing discussion of the centennial over the next three years.
