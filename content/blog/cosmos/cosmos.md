Cosmos is a student project from 2011. It is a 4-page editorial spread that appropriated the transcription of my favorite episode of Cosmos. The “Backbone of Night” is about the mystery and the compelling nature of the universe.  

The theme of space was first created by a typography exercise called illustrated word. I also like to think of it as words at play. Matteo Bologna would call it type masturbation.

A valuable piece of inspiration for this piece was the image library at the mid-manhattan branch of the New York Public Library. There they have a catalogue of thousands of images. The most interesting images were etchings and lithographs. These images are incorporated throughout the 4-page editorial spread.
