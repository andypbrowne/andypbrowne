I’m the only one in my house who drinks milk. Sure, it makes the occasional guest appearance in mac-and-cheese or pancakes, but for the most part, it’s just me and my weekend coffee. The problem? My milk kept turning on me before I could finish it.

Then I discovered a trick: squash the container—literally. Press out as much air as possible before sealing it back up. Less oxygen means fresher milk, and this little hack has extended its life by at least a week.

Bonus tip: Higher-quality and organic milk naturally lasts longer. But even then? Yeah, I’m still squashing.
