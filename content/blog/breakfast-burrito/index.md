## Preparation

- ⏳ Prep 15 min • Cook 35 min  
- 🍽️ Makes 4 burritos

</aside>

1. Boil diced potatoes 5 minutes, drain and let steam-dry. For best texture you can skip pre-boil and cook a bit longer in the skillet.
2. Cook the homefries - Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high. Add diced potatoes in a single layer and let brown without stirring for 3–4 minutes. Stir, add the diced onion, season with salt and pepper, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are golden and tender (12–18 minutes total). Transfer to a bowl and keep warm.
3. Brown the chorizo - In the same skillet, add the chorizo (no oil needed if packing is fatty). Cook, breaking up with a spatula, until cooked through and slightly crisp, about 5–7 minutes. Spoon onto a plate lined with a paper towel to drain excess fat.
4. Scramble the eggs - Complete this step according to your personal taste
5. Warm tortillas - Wrap in paper towel and microwave or warm on skillet or oven.
6. Assemble - Add a layer of homefries, a scoop of chorizo, scrambled eggs, shredded cheese, avocado slices, a spoonful of salsa, a dollop of sour cream, chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of lime.
7. Finish (optional) - For a pressed burrito, fold ends and roll tightly, then toast seam-side down in a hot skillet (1–2 minutes per side) until golden and the cheese melts. Serve - Cut in half, serve with extra salsa, and any reserved homefries on the side.

Enjoy — these hold well wrapped for a morning on the go. Adjust heat and fillings to taste (swap chorizo for black beans or add breakfast potatoes spices like smoked paprika for extra depth).
