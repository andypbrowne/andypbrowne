## Preparation

<aside>

- 🔥 One-skillet homefries + quick scramble  
- ⏳ Prep 15 min • Cook 35 min  
- 🍽️ Makes 4 burritos

</aside>

1. Boil diced potatoes 5 minutes, drain and let steam-dry. For best texture you can skip parboil and cook a bit longer in the skillet.
2. Cook the homefries - Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high. Add diced potatoes in a single layer and let brown without stirring for 3–4 minutes. Stir, add the diced onion and bell pepper, season with salt and pepper, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are golden and tender (12–18 minutes total). Transfer to a bowl and keep warm.
3. Brown the chorizo - In the same skillet, add the chorizo (no oil needed if packing is fatty). Cook, breaking up with a spatula, until cooked through and slightly crisp, about 5–7 minutes. Spoon onto a plate lined with a paper towel to drain excess fat.
4. Scramble the eggs - Whisk eggs with milk (or water), a pinch of salt and pepper. Wipe the skillet clean, add a little butter or oil over medium-low heat, pour eggs in, and gently scramble until just set but still moist. Remove from heat.
5. Warm tortillas & assemble - Warm tortillas in a dry skillet or wrap in a damp towel and microwave 20–30 seconds. Build each burrito: a layer of homefries, a scoop of chorizo, scrambled eggs, shredded cheese, avocado slices, a spoonful of salsa, a dollop of sour cream, chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of lime.
6. Finish (optional) - For a pressed burrito, fold ends and roll tightly, then toast seam-side down in a hot skillet (1–2 minutes per side) until golden and the cheese melts.p
7. Serve - Cut in half, serve with extra salsa, lime wedges, and any reserved homefries on the side.

Enjoy — these hold well wrapped for a morning on the go. Adjust heat and fillings to taste (swap chorizo for black beans or add breakfast potatoes spices like smoked paprika for extra depth).
