This [plush toy](https://iam8bit.jp/en/products/monument-valley-2-monument-valley-2-dotem) is my favorite amongst the scores, maybe hundreds, of stuffed animals my daughter owns. Totem, our favorite character in the game [Monument Valley](https://www.monumentvalleygame.com/mv3), is a movable pillar that helps the main character with puzzles. Totem can slide around to create paths, bridge gaps, and transport the main character through a magic door. Its great to have a reminder of a game my kid and I can play together.

Why do we like Monument Valley so much? The music, beautiful graphics, and puzzles that are just the right amount of difficulty. Also there is a tactile element to the gameplay that just feels relaxing and satisfying.
