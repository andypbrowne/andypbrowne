A stylish tool for amateur work and do-it-yourself (DIY) projects around the house â€“ the [Hoto Brushless Drill](https://hototools.com/products/hoto-12v-brushless-drill) is a power tool that has me looking for excuses to do repair work and projects around the house. Some of the best features are: a digital display; adjustible torque, and USB-C recharging. In a world of really expensive professional tools and a hoard of cheap household tools this strikes a great balance. 

Some of the downsides: a non-replaceable battery pack and a long-recharging wait time; and the case it comes with is not so great. So I'm reminding myself to recharge it as I am writing this. I'm also looiing for a DIY project to build the drill its own case!
