Rest in peace [SpotifyÂ© Car Thing](https://carthing.spotify.com/). This recently discontinued device was a really fresh experience for audio. Even the packaging for this *thing* was a great experience. When reflecting on itâ€™s 3-years of use, I found more utility for at my desk than in the car. That big dial you see allowed me physical volume control when I was playing music on Zoom for my coworkers. During those pandemic years I was actually well known as a DJ and provider of vibes among my colleagues. They were attending too many boring meetings and I had figured out how to provide a high-quality stream. That dial was a cool way to control the music volume separately than the rest of my computer audio. Now all of that is gone.

Iâ€™m not really the reactionary type â€“ but this is a really good excuse to switch to Apple Music out of protest. Apparently in December 2024 the device is going to turn into a brick ðŸ§±. [The Car Thing discontinued FAQ](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/) even tells me to dispose of it according to local electronic waste guidelinesâ€¦ Iâ€™m not going to do that. Iâ€™ll keep it mounted on the wall in hopes that it one day gets revived or I can hack its internals to help me stream music from some other expendable service.
