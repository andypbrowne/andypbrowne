H</span>ow do you find new podcasts? For me, discovery never happens by just browsing a podcast app. I am always looking for personal recommendations or hot tips on my twitter feed.  In the spirit of relevant recommendations, I am offering my go-to **podcasts** and **favorite episodes** broken down into mostly nonsensical categories of _Road Trip_, _Morning Commuting_, _Sleep Aids_, and _Design Learning_ (Because I am a UX Designer).

What podcasts do you listen to and in which category do they fit? [Let me know on twitter](https://twitter.com/dtandyb/status/1115472627915722753).

### Sleep Aids

Do you have trouble falling asleep. Much like a good National Public Radio (NPR) show these podcasts will quiet your mind and help you sleep. These podcasts are generally shorter in duration (~20min) which reduces the likelihood of falling asleep in the middle.
