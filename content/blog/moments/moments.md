A man laboriously moves his piano down three levels onto the subway platform. Classic vocals and strided chords — he played so well I swore he was blind. Oblivious to the heat on that August stage, he was most in touch with his audience — whom he elevated with his music.

The local neighborhood bar has a quiet time between six and nine. It is a place that specializes in coffee, beer and seasonal menus. There is just enough of each for a satisfying snack and effective buzz. After the time when the laptop lids close and before the social gatherings start — there is a sort of twilight*. Often this time is a fugitive ground rife with creative inspiration and meditative work — of the kind that results in personal reward.

\* twilight may refer to civil, nautical or astronomical variety depending on your social or terrestrial condition
