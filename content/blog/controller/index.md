I’m not the gamer I was back in my teens. I think in middle age console games in-particular give me a headache. This does not stop me from swooning over the design of the [Playstation 5 Controller](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller/). I bought it so that my daughter and I could play games on Apple TV 4K. There are some great games on there for us including *Angry Birds*, *Donut County*, and *Cooking Mama: Let's cook*! There are also a couple that I could not personally resit like *LEGO® Star Wars<sup>TM</sup> Battles* that I could not resist. I ended up with a headache. Next I’m hoping to also hook up the controller to my laptop to play *Untitled Goose Game* and *Bluey the Video Game* with my daughter.

This controller is a thing of beauty and I think it mostly reminds me of the joy I had as a kid when playing new video games. It also re-charges via USB-C.
