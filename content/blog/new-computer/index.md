Today I got a new computer. Even though I had made a list days prior – I still spend a whole day installing apps. Here is a list that I made it most of the way through. They are mostly native apps I installed. I'm very excited about having a more streamlined setup thanks to this house cleaning effort.

## Productivity

1. Password Manager - been using one for several years now and it helped make this process painless.
1. [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/gift/8e456a36) - This is my browser because it has split screen and a bunch of other user-friendly features.
1. [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) - I really appriciate the selective sync feature. I'm also a big user of [Dropbox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/) which I use to draft longer posts and collaborate on edits. There are a lot of features here that I wish I could use at work.
1. [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) - I keep up with my work colleagues here. One key feature is how it avoices the blue bubble problem. 
1. [Whatsapp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) - In my experience this is the only app to talk to people who are international, like some additional work colleagues.
1. [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/) - This is the way I talk to family
1. [Slack](https://slack.com/) - I am a member of several organizations including Research Operations, DesignOps Assembly, Sanity-io-land, among others
1. [Discord](https://discord.com/) - There are some other communities I like to hop into once and a while. Ask me what they are.
1. [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) - I'm discontent with it, but what else is there?
1. [Outlook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/outlook/email-and-calendar-software-microsoft-outlook) - This is honestly really good and it is amazing to see Microsoft starting to have great design in their applications. I like using Outlook because the email and calendar are in the same app. I also have to use it at work – so I have muscle memory for it.
1. [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) - I sometimes make ebooks, and without inDesign this is the best way to do it.

## De$ign Stuff

1. [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - This app has been a game changer for the industry and I'm not sorry about being a groupie
1. [Affinity Suite](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) - I have version 1 of thier apps Photo, Designer, and Publisher. For my purposes there is not yet a need to upgrade to v2 – and [they promise](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/press/newsroom/affinity-and-canva-pledge/) that thier perpetual licenses will always be offered. 
1. [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) - I've always loved video editing and I'm hoping to get to play around a little now that I have a more powerful laptop. Bonus points because this is a free app!
1. [Colour Contrast Checker](https://usecontrast.com/) - I use the mac app to make sure that designs are accessible.
1. [Mouseless](https://github.com/ueberdosis/mouseless/) - This is a gamified app to learn keyboard shortcuts - which is a superpower of great technologists. I just found out that development has been discontinued.

## Development Stuff

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - This is what I use to make this website and other small websites for friends and family.
1. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - This is how I get web development sarted and downloaded Node so that I can make this website.
1. I installed a couple of command line interfaces including Sanity CLI, Netlify CLI, and Github CLI. Thats because I’m doing my best to look cool while computing.

## For Fun

1. [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/) - I listen to more [podcasts](https://andypbrowne.com/blog/podcasts/) on here than I do music. But right now I’m listening to my favorite playlist called [Dark Wave](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EIfznZ4V4VKcm?si=df215a350e764e02).
1. [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) - With my new more powerful machine I hope to play some games with my daugher including: *Untitled Goose Game*, *Nour: Play with your Food*, my old favorite *Firewatch* and *Bluey: The Video Game* (afraid this one is windows-only).
