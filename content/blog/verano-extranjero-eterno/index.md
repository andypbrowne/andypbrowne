I think often about the summer I never spent abroad. This would have been that privileged semester that I spent in Madrid, Spain – but it never happened IRL.

I didn’t get to take advantage of something like that because I was busy playing Army in the ROTC Department. There were some required courses and it was just something that was not done. During the summer of my sophomore year, I went to [Airborne School](https://www.army.mil/article/266307/army_airborne_school_helps_service_members_pursue_passions_enhance_careers). This is like an elective that gives you a jump start for my Army career. Learning how to jump out of a perfectly good airplane is cool and all – but I think I would now appreciate the experience and growth of time in a new country. Some of my classmates disappeared and seemed to come back so wise and cultured. I could imagine them living their own version of [Before Sunrise](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112471/).

So what if I could imagine that alternate reality where I did travel to Spain right around the year 2000. I might remember some of the music, nightlife, food, and the most memorable sights.

## The Music

If I had studied in Spain – I think I might remember the music. So to fabricate this trip I have made [a playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2mTDoROy5xRo6mMDRuG2VU?si=60b9015b123d4858) (see embed above). It includes music mostly from around the year 2000. But also, in the spirit of an eternal foreign summer (Verano Extranjero Eterno), I have included some additional modern tracks. One of the great things about Spanish music is its international variety. On this list, you will see artists from Spain, Columbia, Argentina, and many more. It's a great window into the Spanish language and I would like to think I could now be fluent if I was immersed in the music and culture at just the right time. 

## Nightlife and Food

In Spain, you learn to socialize out in sidewalk cafes and experience the nightlife late into the evening. One of my favorites would surely have been [Bar El Tigre](https://bareltigre.es/). This is a spot that offers free tapas with every drink order – perfect for a student on a budget. Don’t forget that lunch is the biggest meal in Spain. Embracing the large lunch and siesta just after is 

When I’m looking for places to go these days I’m always starting with the coffee shops and bookstores. I’ve got a [list of some](https://foursquare.com/dtandyb/list/cl%C3%A1sico-madrid) of the places for that. My partner and I now like to sa*y there are no wrong turns in Madrid*. So the idea is to just pick a spot and just walk.

## The Sights

The thing to remember about Madrid is how clean the city is. The subway is sleek, modern, and reliable. A student studying abroad might live with a host family in any neighborhood and easily take the subway to class as well as many cultural institutions.

The places I might remember most are El Rastro flea market, Parque del Retiro, or even just drinking wine at a public park. 

The Renia Sophia might be the most memorable museum (that is where I took my daughter to see Guernica just last year) but the Prado is also amazing because you can see El Greco, Velázquez, and Goya. The best thing is never to over-plan your visit to Madrid. 

My sister studied abroad in Spain. I think some of the things she remembers most were the mini-trips to neighboring cities like Barcelona, Seville, or Valencia. There are also so many day trips to places like Ávila, Segovia, and Toledo. These are ancient places with visible history. Such an adjustment for those of us who live in a country with only a 200-year history. 

Well, thanks for going on this journey with me. If you did find this secret RSS Club post I hope you tell me where your version of this story.
